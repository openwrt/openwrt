	config BUILD_PATENTED
		default y
		bool "Compile with support for patented functionality"
		help
		  When this option is disabled, software which provides patented functionality
		  will not be built.  In case software provides optional support for patented
		  functionality, this optional support will get disabled for this package.

	config BUILD_NLS
		default n
		bool "Compile with full language support"
		help
		  When this option is enabled, packages are built with the full versions of
		  iconv and GNU gettext instead of the default OpenWrt stubs. If uClibc is
		  used, it is also built with locale support.

	config SHADOW_PASSWORDS
		bool
		prompt "Enable shadow password support"
		default y
		help
		  Enable shadow password support.

	config CLEAN_IPKG
		bool
		prompt "Remove ipkg/opkg status data files in final images"
		default n

		  This removes all ipkg/opkg status data files from the target directory
		  before building the root filesystem.

	config COLLECT_KERNEL_DEBUG
		bool
		prompt "Collect kernel debug information"
		select KERNEL_DEBUG_INFO
		default n
		help
		  This collects debugging symbols from the kernel and all compiled modules.
		  Useful for release builds, so that kernel issues can be debugged offline
		  later.

	config DEBUG
		bool
		prompt "Compile packages with debugging info"
		default n
		help
		  Adds -g3 to the CFLAGS.

	config IPV6
		bool
		prompt "Enable IPv6 support in packages"
		default y
		help
		  Enable IPv6 support in packages (passes --enable-ipv6 to configure scripts).

	config PKG_BUILD_PARALLEL
		bool
		prompt "Compile certain packages parallelized"
		default y
		help
		  This adds a -jX option to certain packages that are known to behave well
		  for parallel build. By default, the package make processes use the main
		  jobserver, in which case this option only takes effect when you add -jX
		  to the make command.

		  If you are unsure, select N.

	config PKG_BUILD_USE_JOBSERVER
		bool
		prompt "Use top-level make jobserver for packages"
		depends on PKG_BUILD_PARALLEL
		default y
		help
		  This passes the main make process jobserver fds to package builds,
		  enabling full parallelization across different packages.

		  Note that disabling this may overcommit CPU resources depending on the
		  -j level of the main make process, the number of package submake jobs
		  selected below and the number of actual CPUs present.
		  Example: If the main make is passed a -j4 and the submake -j
		  is also set to 4, we may end up with 16 parallel make processes
		  in the worst case.

	config PKG_BUILD_JOBS

		  The number of jobs (-jX) to pass to packages submake.

	config PKG_DEFAULT_PARALLEL
		bool
		prompt "Parallelize the default package build rule (May break build)"
		depends on PKG_BUILD_PARALLEL
		depends on BROKEN
		default n
		help
		  Always set the default package build rules to parallel build.

		  WARNING: This may break build or kill your cat, as it builds packages
		  with multiple jobs that are probably not tested in a parallel build
		  environment.

		  Only say Y if you don't mind fixing broken packages.  Before reporting
		  build bugs, set this to N and re-run the build.

	config STRIP_KERNEL_EXPORTS
		bool "Strip unnecessary exports from the kernel image"
		help
		  Reduces kernel size by stripping unused kernel exports from the kernel
		  image.  Note that this might make the kernel incompatible with any kernel
		  modules that were not selected at the time the kernel image was created.

	config USE_MKLIBS
		bool "Strip unnecessary functions from libraries"
		help
		  Reduces libraries to only those functions that are necessary for using all
		  selected packages (including those selected as <M>).  Note that this will
		  make the system libraries incompatible with most of the packages that are
		  not selected during the build process.

	choice
		prompt "Preferred standard C++ library"
