 * This file defines the cryptographic functions that need to be implemented
 * for wpa_supplicant and hostapd. When TLS is not used, internal
 * implementation of MD5, SHA1, and AES is used and no external libraries are
 * required. When TLS is enabled (e.g., by enabling EAP-TLS or EAP-PEAP), the
 * crypto library used by the TLS implementation is expected to be used for
 * non-TLS needs, too, in order to save space by not implementing these
 * functions twice.
 *
 * Wrapper code for using each crypto library is in its own file (crypto*.c)
 * and one of these files is build and linked in to provide the functions
 * defined here.

  *  Note that we take it "backwards" and put the highest-order term in          
  *  the lowest-order bit.  The X^32 term is "implied"; the LSB is the           
  *  X^31 term, etc.  The X^0 term (usually shown as "+1") results in            
  *  the MSB being 1

  *  Note that the usual hardware shift register implementation, which           
  *  is what we're using (we're merely optimizing it by doing eight-bit          
  *  chunks at a time) shifts bits into the lowest-order term.  In our           
  *  implementation, that means shifting towards the right.  Why do we           
  *  do it this way?  Because the calculated CRC must be transmitted in          
  *  order from highest-order term to lowest-order term.  UARTs transmit         
  *  characters in order from LSB to MSB.  By storing the CRC this way           
  *  we hand it to the UART in the order low-byte to high-byte; the UART         
  *  sends each low-bit to hight-bit; and the result is transmission bit         
  *  by bit from highest- to lowest-order term without requiring any bit         
  *  shuffling on our part.  Reception works similarly                           
  *                                                                              
  *  The feedback terms table consists of 256, 32-bit entries.  Notes            
  *                                                                              
  *      The table can be generated at runtime if desired; code to do so         
  *      is shown later.  It might not be obvious, but the feedback              
  *      terms simply represent the results of eight shift/xor opera             
  *      tions for all combinations of data and CRC register values              
  *                                                                              
  *      The values must be right-shifted by eight bits by the "updcrc           
  *      logic; the shift must be unsigned (bring in zeroes).  On some           
  *      hardware you could probably optimize the shift in assembler by          
  *      using byte-swap instructions
