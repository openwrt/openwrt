Subject: [PATCH] brcmfmac: add missing eth_type_trans call
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

There are 2 protocols supported by brcmfmac and msgbuf one was missing a
proper skb setup before passing it to the netif. This was triggering
"NULL pointer dereference".
