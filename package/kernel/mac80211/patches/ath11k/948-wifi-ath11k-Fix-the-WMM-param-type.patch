Subject: [PATCH] wifi: ath11k: Fix the WMM param type

Since FW does not support the 11ax EDCA parameter in WMI TLV command.
FW was crashing as host was sending this parameter, now changed the
WMM parameter type as default zero before sending to FW.

Fixes: b78c02f7c710 ("wifi: ath11k: add support for MU EDCA")
