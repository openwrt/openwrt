    ath9k: fix ps-poll responses under a-mpdu sessions
    
    When passing tx frames to the U-APSD queue for powersave poll responses,
    the ath_atx_tid pointer needs to be passed to ath_tx_setup_buffer for
    proper sequence number accounting.
    
    This fixes high latency and connection stability issues with ath9k
    running as AP and a few kinds of mobile phones as client, when PS-Poll
    is heavily used

    mac80211: fix station wakeup powersave race
    
    Consider the following (relatively unlikely) scenario:
     1) station goes to sleep while frames are buffered in driver
     2) driver blocks wakeup (until no more frames are buffered)
     3) station wakes up again
     4) driver unblocks wakeup
    
    In this case, the current mac80211 code will do the following:
     1) WLAN_STA_PS_STA set
     2) WLAN_STA_PS_DRIVER set
     3) - nothing -
     4) WLAN_STA_PS_DRIVER cleared
    
    As a result, no frames will be delivered to the client, even
    though it is awake, until it sends another frame to us that
    triggers ieee80211_sta_ps_deliver_wakeup() in sta_ps_end().
    
    Since we now take the PS spinlock, we can fix this while at
    the same time removing the complexity with the pending skb
    queue function. This was broken since my commit 50a9432daeec
    ("mac80211: fix powersaving clients races") due to removing
    the clearing of WLAN_STA_PS_STA in the RX path.
    
    While at it, fix a cleanup path issue when a station is
    removed while the driver is still blocking its wakeup.

    mac80211: insert stations before adding to driver
    
    There's a race condition in mac80211 because we add stations
    to the internal lists after adding them to the driver, which
    means that (for example) the following can happen:
     1. a station connects and is added
     2. first, it is added to the driver
     3. then, it is added to the mac80211 lists
    
    If the station goes to sleep between steps 2 and 3, and the
    firmware/hardware records it as being asleep, mac80211 will
    never instruct the driver to wake it up again as it never
    realized it went to sleep since the RX path discarded the
    frame as a "spurious class 3 frame", no station entry was
    present yet.
    
    Fix this by adding the station in software first, and only
    then adding it to the driver. That way, any state that the
    driver changes will be reflected properly in mac80211's
    station state. The problematic part is the roll-back if the
    driver fails to add the station, in that case a bit more is
    needed. To not make that overly complex prevent starting BA
    sessions in the meantime.

    mac80211: fix AP powersave TX vs. wakeup race
    
    There is a race between the TX path and the STA wakeup: while
    a station is sleeping, mac80211 buffers frames until it wakes
    up, then the frames are transmitted. However, the RX and TX
    path are concurrent, so the packet indicating wakeup can be
    processed while a packet is being transmitted.
    
    This can lead to a situation where the buffered frames list
    is emptied on the one side, while a frame is being added on
    the other side, as the station is still seen as sleeping in
    the TX path.
    
    As a result, the newly added frame will not be send anytime
    soon. It might be sent much later (and out of order) when the
    station goes to sleep and wakes up the next time.
    
    Additionally, it can lead to the crash below.
    
    Fix all this by synchronising both paths with a new lock.
    Both path are not fastpath since they handle PS situations.
    
    In a later patch we'll remove the extra skb queue locks to
    reduce locking overhead.

    rtl8187: fix regression on MIPS without coherent DMA
    
    This patch fixes regression caused by commit a16dad77634 "MIPS: Fix
    potencial corruption". That commit fixes one corruption scenario in
    cost of adding another one, which actually start to cause crashes
    on Yeeloong laptop when rtl8187 driver is used.
    
    For correct DMA read operation on machines without DMA coherence, kernel
    have to invalidate cache, such it will refill later with new data that
    device wrote to memory, when that data is needed to process. We can only
    invalidate full cache line. Hence when cache line includes both dma
    buffer and some other data (written in cache, but not yet in main
    memory), the other data can not hit memory due to invalidation. That
    happen on rtl8187 where struct rtl8187_priv fields are located just
    before and after small buffers that are passed to USB layer and DMA
    is performed on them.
    
    To fix the problem we align buffers and reserve space after them to make
    them match cache line.
    
    This patch does not resolve all possible MIPS problems entirely, for
    that we have to assure that we always map cache aligned buffers for DMA,
    what can be complex or even not possible. But patch fixes visible and
    reproducible regression and seems other possible corruptions do not
    happen in practice, since Yeeloong laptop works stable without rtl8187
    driver.

    IQ calibration post-processing for AR955x is different

    Also, to simplify things, a helper routine to issue/poll
    AGC calibration is used.

    in subsequent patches) is set to zero.

    cfg80211: consider existing DFS interfaces
    
    It was possible to break interface combinations in
    the following way:
    
     combo 1: iftype = AP, num_ifaces = 2, num_chans = 2,
     combo 2: iftype = AP, num_ifaces = 1, num_chans = 1, radar = HT20
    
    With the above interface combinations it was
    possible to:
    
     step 1. start AP on DFS channel by matching combo 2
     step 2. start AP on non-DFS channel by matching combo 1
    
    This was possible beacuse (step 2) did not consider
    if other interfaces require radar detection.

    instead of channel itself now a complete chandef

    The result is a mismatching channel configuration between
    cfg80211 and the driver, that can lead to any sort of
    problem.
    
    The issue can be triggered by having an IBSS sitting on
    given channel and then asking the driver to create a new
    cell using the same BSSID but with a different frequency.
    By passing the channel to cfg80211_get_bss() we can solve
    this ambiguity and retrieve/create the correct BSS object.
    All the users of cfg80211_ibss_joined() have been changed
    accordingly.
    
    Moreover WARN when cfg80211_ibss_joined() gets a NULL
    channel as argument and remove a bogus call of the same
    function in ath6kl (it does not make sense to call
    cfg80211_ibss_joined() with a zero BSSID on ibss-leave).

    mac80211: fix bufferable MMPDU RX handling
    
    Action, disassoc and deauth frames are bufferable, and as such don't
    have the PM bit in the frame control field reserved which means we
    need to react to the bit when receiving in such a frame.
    
    Fix this by introducing a new helper ieee80211_is_bufferable_mmpdu()
    and using it for the RX path that currently ignores the PM bit in
    any non-data frames for doze->wake transitions, but listens to it in
    all frames for wake->doze transitions, both of which are wrong.
    
    Also use the new helper in the TX path to clean up the code.

    mac80211: fix fragmentation code, particularly for encryption
    
    The "new" fragmentation code (since my rewrite almost 5 years ago)
    erroneously sets skb->len rather than using skb_trim() to adjust
    the length of the first fragment after copying out all the others.
    This leaves the skb tail pointer pointing to after where the data
    originally ended, and thus causes the encryption MIC to be written
    at that point, rather than where it belongs: immediately after the
    data.
    
    The impact of this is that if software encryption is done, then
     a) encryption doesn't work for the first fragment, the connection
        becomes unusable as the first fragment will never be properly
        verified at the receiver, the MIC is practically guaranteed to
        be wrong
     b) we leak up to 8 bytes of plaintext (!) of the packet out into
        the air
    
    This is only mitigated by the fact that many devices are capable
    of doing encryption in hardware, in which case this can't happen
    as the tail pointer is irrelevant in that case. Additionally,
    fragmentation is not used very frequently and would normally have
    to be configured manually.
    
    Fix this by using skb_trim() properly.

    cfg80211: send scan results from work queue
    
    Due to the previous commit, when a scan finishes, it is in theory
    possible to hit the following sequence:
     1. interface starts being removed
     2. scan is cancelled by driver and cfg80211 is notified
     3. scan done work is scheduled
     4. interface is removed completely, rdev->scan_req is freed,
        event sent to userspace but scan done work remains pending
     5. new scan is requested on another virtual interface
     6. scan done work runs, freeing the still-running scan
    
    To fix this situation, hang on to the scan done message and block
    new scans while that is the case, and only send the message from
    the work function, regardless of whether the scan_req is already
    freed from interface removal. This makes step 5 above impossible
    and changes step 6 to be
     5. scan done work runs, sending the scan done message
    
    As this can't work for wext, so we send the message immediately,
    but this shouldn't be an issue since we still return -EBUSY.

    cfg80211: fix scan done race
    
    When an interface/wdev is removed, any ongoing scan should be
    cancelled by the driver. This will make it call cfg80211, which
    only queues a work struct. If interface/wdev removal is quick
    enough, this can leave the scan request pending and processed
    only after the interface is gone, causing a use-after-free.
    
    Fix this by making sure the scan request is not pending after
    the interface is destroyed. We can't flush or cancel the work
    item due to locking concerns, but when it'll run it shouldn't
    find anything to do. This leaves a potential issue, if a new
    scan gets requested before the work runs, it prematurely stops
    the running scan, potentially causing another crash. I'll fix
    that in the next patch.
    
    This was particularly observed with P2P_DEVICE wdevs, likely
    because freeing them is quicker than freeing netdevs.

    nl80211: send event when AP operation is stopped
    
    There are a few cases, e.g. suspend, where an AP interface is
    stopped by the kernel rather than by userspace request, most
    commonly when suspending. To let userspace know about this,
    send the NL80211_CMD_STOP_AP command as an event every time
    an AP interface is stopped. This also happens when userspace
    did in fact request the AP stop, but that's not a problem.
    
    For full-MAC drivers this may need to be extended to also
    cover cases where the device stopped the AP operation for
    some reason, this a bit more complicated because then all
    cfg80211 state also needs to be reset; such API is not part
    of this patch.

    nl80211: fix scheduled scan RSSI matchset attribute confusion
    
    The scheduled scan matchsets were intended to be a list of filters,
    with the found BSS having to pass at least one of them to be passed
    to the host. When the RSSI attribute was added, however, this was
    broken and currently wpa_supplicant adds that attribute in its own
    matchset; however, it doesn't intend that to mean that anything
    that passes the RSSI filter should be passed to the host, instead
    it wants it to mean that everything needs to also have higher RSSI.
    
    This is semantically problematic because we have a list of filters
    like [ SSID1, SSID2, SSID3, RSSI ] with no real indication which
    one should be OR'ed and which one AND'ed.
    
    To fix this, move the RSSI filter attribute into each matchset. As
    we need to stay backward compatible, treat a matchset with only the
    RSSI attribute as a "default RSSI filter" for all other matchsets,
    but only if there are other matchsets (an RSSI-only matchset by
    itself is still desirable.)
    
    To make driver implementation easier, keep a global min_rssi_thold
    for the entire request as well. The only affected driver is ath6kl.
    
    I found this when I looked into the code after Raja Mani submitted
    a patch fixing the n_match_sets calculation to disregard the RSSI,
    but that patch didn't address the semantic issue.

    nl80211: check nla_parse() return values
    
    If there's a policy, then nla_parse() return values must be
    checked, otherwise the policy is useless and there's nothing
    that ensures the attributes are actually what we expect them
    to be.

    mac80211: send {ADD,DEL}BA on AC_VO like other mgmt frames, as per spec
    
    ATM, {ADD,DEL}BA and BAR frames are sent on the AC matching the TID of
    the BA parameters. In the discussion [1] about this patch, Johannes
    recalled that it fixed some races with the DELBA and indeed this
    behavior was introduced in [2].
    While [2] is right for the BARs, the part queueing the {ADD,DEL}BAs on
    their BA params TID AC violates the spec and is more a workaround for
    some drivers. Helmut expressed some concerns wrt such drivers, in
    particular DELBAs in rt2x00.
    
    ATM, DELBAs are sent after a driver has called (hence "purposely")
    ieee80211_start_tx_ba_cb_irqsafe and Johannes and Emmanuel gave some
    details wrt intentions behind the split of the IEEE80211_AMPDU_TX_STOP_*
    given to the driver ampdu_action supposed to call this function, which
    could prove handy to people trying to do the right thing in faulty
    drivers (if their fw/hw don't get in their way).
