    ath9k_htc: fix random decryption failure
    
    In v3.15 the driver stopped to accept network packets after successful
    authentification, which could be worked around by passing the
    nohwcrypt=1 module parameter.  This was not reproducible by
    everyone, and showed random behaviour in some tests.
    It was caused by an uninitialized variable introduced
    in 4ed1a8d4a257 ("ath9k_htc: use ath9k_cmn_rx_accept") and
    used in 341b29b9cd2f ("ath9k_htc: use ath9k_cmn_rx_skb_postprocess").

    ath9k_hw: fix PLL clock initialization for newer SoC
    
    On AR934x and newer SoC devices, the layout of the AR_RTC_PLL_CONTROL
    register changed. This currently breaks at least 5/10 MHz operation.
    AR933x uses the old layout.
    
    It might also have been causing other stability issues because of the
    different location of the PLL_BYPASS bit which needs to be set during
    PLL clock initialization.
    
    This patch also removes more instances of hardcoded register values in
    favor of properly computed ones with the PLL_BYPASS bit added.

    ath9k_hw: reduce ANI spur immunity setting on HT40 extension channel
    
    The cycpwr_thr1 value needs to be lower on the extension channel than on
    the control channel, similar to how the register settings are programmed
    in the initvals.
    
    Also drop the unnecessary check for HT40 - this register can always be
    written. This patch has been reported to improve HT40 stability and
    throughput in some environments.

    If an aggregation session fails, frames still end up in the driver queue

    ath9k: fix pending tx frames accounting
    
    Packets originally buffered for the regular hardware tx queues can end
    up being transmitted through the U-APSD queue (via PS-Poll or U-APSD).
    When packets are dropped due to retransmit failures, the pending frames
    counter is not always updated properly.
    Fix this by keeping track of the queue that a frame was accounted for in
    the ath_frame_info struct, and using that on completion to decide
    whether the counter should be updated.
    This fixes some spurious transmit queue hangs.

    ath9k/ath10k: remove unnecessary channel_switch_beacon callbacks
    
    The channel_switch_beacon callback is optional, so it doesn't have to
    be defined if it's not going to do anything useful with it.  Both
    ath9k and ath10k define the callback and just returns.  This commit
    removes them.

    ath9k: Fix deadlock while updating p2p beacon timer
    
    pm_lock is taken twice while syncing HW TSF of p2p vif.
    Fix this by taking the lock at caller side.

    rt2x00: change order when stop beaconing
    
    When no beaconing is needed, first stop beacon queue (disable beaconing
    globally) to avoid possible sending of not prepared beacon on short
    period after clearing beacon and before stop of BCN queue.

    rt2x00: change beaconing setup on RT2800
    
    As reported by Matthias, on 5572 chip, even if we clear up TXWI
    of corresponding beacon, hardware still try to send it or do other
    action that increase power consumption peak up to 1A.
    
    To avoid the issue, setup beaconing dynamically by configuring offsets
    of currently active beacons and MAC_BSSID_DW1_BSS_BCN_NUM variable,
    which limit number of beacons that hardware will try to send.

    mac80211: fix station/driver powersave race
    
    It is currently possible to have a race due to the station PS
    unblock work like this:
     * station goes to sleep with frames buffered in the driver
     * driver blocks wakeup
     * station wakes up again
     * driver flushes/returns frames, and unblocks, which schedules
       the unblock work
     * unblock work starts to run, and checks that the station is
       awake (i.e. that the WLAN_STA_PS_STA flag isn't set)
     * we process a received frame with PM=1, setting the flag again
     * ieee80211_sta_ps_deliver_wakeup() runs, delivering all frames
       to the driver, and then clearing the WLAN_STA_PS_DRIVER and
       WLAN_STA_PS_STA flags
    
    In this scenario, mac80211 will think that the station is awake,
    while it really is asleep, and any TX'ed frames should be filtered
    by the device (it will know that the station is sleeping) but then
    passed to mac80211 again, which will not buffer it either as it
    thinks the station is awake, and eventually the packets will be
    dropped.
    
    Fix this by moving the clearing of the flags to exactly where we
    learn about the situation. This creates a problem of reordering,
    so introduce another flag indicating that delivery is being done,
    this new flag also queues frames and is cleared only while the
    spinlock is held (which the queuing code also holds) so that any
    concurrent delivery/TX is handled correctly.

    mac80211: reduce packet loss notifications under load
    
    During strong signal fluctuations under high throughput, few consecutive
    failed A-MPDU transmissions can easily trigger packet loss notification,
    and thus (in AP mode) client disconnection.
    
    Reduce the number of false positives by checking the A-MPDU status flag
    and treating a failed A-MPDU as a single packet.

    ath9k: avoid passing buffers to the hardware during flush
    
    The commit "ath9k: fix possible hang on flush" changed the receive code
    to always link rx descriptors of processed frames, even when flushing.
    In some cases, this leads to flushed rx buffers being passed to the
    hardware while rx is already stopped.
