Subject: [PATCH] brcmfmac: add missing break when deleting P2P_DEVICE
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We obviously don't want to fall through in that switch. With this change
1) We wait for event (triggered by p2p_disc) as expected
2) We remove interface manually on timeout
3) We return 0 on success instead of -ENOTSUPP
