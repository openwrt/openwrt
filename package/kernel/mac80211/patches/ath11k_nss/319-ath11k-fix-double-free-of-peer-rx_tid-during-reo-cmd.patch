Subject: [PATCH] ath11k: fix double free of peer rx_tid during reo cmd failure

Peer rx_tid is locally copied thrice during peer_rx_tid_cleanup to send
REO_CMD_UPDATE_RX_QUEUE followed by REO_CMD_FLUSH_CACHE to flush all
aged REO descriptors from HW cache.

When sending REO_CMD_FLUSH_CACHE fails, we do dma unmap of already
mapped rx_tid->vaddr and free it. This is not checked during
reo_cmd_list_cleanup() and dp_reo_cmd_free() before trying to free and
unmap again.

Fix this by setting rx_tid->vaddr NULL in rx tid delete and also wherever
freeing it to check in reo_cmd_list_cleanup() and reo_cmd_free() before
trying to free again.

Prevent REO cmd failures causing double free by increasing REO cmd
ring size and moving REO status ring mask to IRQ group 3 from group
0 to separate from tx completion ring on IRQ group 0 which may delay
reo status processing.
