Subject: [PATCH] brcmfmac: replace WARNING on timeout with a simple error
 message
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Even with timeout increased to 950 ms we get WARNINGs from time to time.
It mostly happens on A-MPDU stalls (e.g. when station goes out of
range). It may take up to 5-10 secods for the firmware to recover and
for that time it doesn't process packets.

It's still useful to have a message on time out as it may indicate some
firmware problem and incorrect key update. Raising a WARNING however
wasn't really that necessary, it doesn't point to any driver bug anymore
and backtrace wasn't much useful.
