Subject: [PATCH] vrx518_tc: allow larger MTU to support RFC4638

vrx518_tc currently sets the interface maximum MTU to the ethernet default
of 1500 bytes by default via ether_setup() called from ptm_setup().

To support 1508 byte baby jumbo frames (RFC4638) for PPPoE connections
over VDSL links as already supported by the VR9 ltq_ptm driver ([1], [2])
set the interface maximum MTU to MAX_MTU.

MAX_MTU is defined in dcdp/inc/tc_common.h to 2002 bytes and this value is
used in ptm_change_mtu() and elsewhere as the maximum MTU, however this is
short circuited by checks against the interface maximum MTU.
