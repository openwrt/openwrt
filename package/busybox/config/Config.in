config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_DESKTOP
	bool "Enable options for full-blown desktop systems"
	default n
	help
	  Enable options and features which are not essential.
	  Select this only if you plan to use busybox on full-blown
	  desktop machine with common Linux distro, not on an embedded box.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_ASSUME_UNICODE
	bool "Assume that 1:1 char/glyph correspondence is not true"
	default n
	help
	  This makes various applets aware that one byte is not
	  one character on screen.

	  Busybox aims to eventually work correctly with Unicode displays.
	  Any older encodings are not guaranteed to work.
	  Probably by the time when busybox will be fully Unicode-clean,
	  other encodings will be mainly of historic interest.

choice
	prompt "Buffer allocation policy"
	default BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_BUFFERS_GO_ON_STACK
	help
	  There are 3 ways BusyBox can handle buffer allocations:
	  - Use malloc. This costs code size for the call to xmalloc.
	  - Put them on stack. For some very small machines with limited stack
	    space, this can be deadly.  For most folks, this works just fine.
	  - Put them in BSS. This works beautifully for computers with a real
	    MMU (and OS support), but wastes runtime RAM for uCLinux. This
	    behavior was the only one available for BusyBox versions 0.48 and
	    earlier.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_BUFFERS_USE_MALLOC
	bool "Allocate with Malloc"

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_BUFFERS_GO_ON_STACK
	bool "Allocate on the Stack"

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_BUFFERS_GO_IN_BSS
	bool "Allocate in the .bss section"

endchoice

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SHOW_USAGE
	bool "Show terse applet usage messages"
	default y
	help
	  All BusyBox applets will show help messages when invoked with
	  wrong arguments. You can turn off printing these terse usage
	  messages if you say no here.
	  This will save you up to 7k.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_VERBOSE_USAGE
	bool "Show verbose applet usage messages"
	default y
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SHOW_USAGE
	help
	  All BusyBox applets will show more verbose help messages when
	  busybox is invoked with --help.  This will add a lot of text to the
	  busybox binary.  In the default configuration, this will add about
	  13k, but it can add much more depending on your configuration.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_COMPRESS_USAGE
	bool "Store applet usage messages in compressed form"
	default y
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SHOW_USAGE
	help
	  Store usage messages in compressed form, uncompress them on-the-fly
	  when <applet> --help is called.

	  If you have a really tiny busybox with few applets enabled (and
	  bunzip2 isn't one of them), the overhead of the decompressor might
	  be noticeable.  Also, if you run executables directly from ROM
	  and have very little memory, this might not be a win.  Otherwise,
	  you probably want this.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_INSTALLER
	bool "Support --install [-s] to install applet links at runtime"
	default n
	help
	  Enable 'busybox --install [-s]' support.  This will allow you to use
	  busybox at runtime to create hard links or symlinks for all the
	  applets that are compiled into busybox.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LOCALE_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable locale support (system needs locale for this to work)"
	default n
	help
	  Enable this if your system has locale support and you would like
	  busybox to support locale settings.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_GETOPT_LONG
	bool "Support for --long-options"
	default y
	help
	  Enable this if you want busybox applets to use the gnu --long-option
	  style, in addition to single character -a -b -c style options.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DEVPTS
	bool "Use the devpts filesystem for Unix98 PTYs"
	default y
	help
	  Enable if you want BusyBox to use Unix98 PTY support. If enabled,
	  busybox will use /dev/ptmx for the master side of the pseudoterminal
	  and /dev/pts/<number> for the slave side.  Otherwise, BSD style
	  /dev/ttyp<number> will be used. To use this option, you should have
	  devpts mounted.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_CLEAN_UP
	bool "Clean up all memory before exiting (usually not needed)"
	default n
	help
	  As a size optimization, busybox normally exits without explicitly
	  freeing dynamically allocated memory or closing files.  This saves
	  space since the OS will clean up for us, but it can confuse debuggers
	  like valgrind, which report tons of memory and resource leaks.

	  Don't enable this unless you have a really good reason to clean
	  things up manually.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_PIDFILE
	bool "Support writing pidfiles"
	default y
	help
	  This option makes some applets (e.g. crond, syslogd, inetd) write
	  a pidfile in /var/run. Some applications rely on them.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SUID
	bool "Support for SUID/SGID handling"
	default y
	help
	  With this option you can install the busybox binary belonging
	  to root with the suid bit set, and it'll and it'll automatically drop
	  priviledges for applets that don't need root access.

	  If you're really paranoid and don't want to do this, build two
	  busybox binaries with different applets in them (and the appropriate
	  symlinks pointing to each binary), and only set the suid bit on the
	  one that needs it.  The applets currently marked to need the suid bit
	  are login, passwd, su, ping, traceroute, crontab, dnsd, ipcrm, ipcs,
	  and vlock.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SUID_CONFIG
	bool "Runtime SUID/SGID configuration via /etc/busybox.conf"
	default n if BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SUID
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SUID
	help
	  Allow the SUID / SGID state of an applet to be determined at runtime
	  by checking /etc/busybox.conf.  (This is sort of a poor man's sudo.)
	  The format of this file is as follows:

	  <applet> = [Ssx-][Ssx-][x-] (<username>|<uid>).(<groupname>|<gid>)

	  An example might help:

	  [SUID]
	  su = ssx root.0 # applet su can be run by anyone and runs with euid=0/egid=0
	  su = ssx        # exactly the same

	  mount = sx- root.disk # applet mount can be run by root and members of group disk
	                        # and runs with euid=0

	  cp = --- # disable applet cp for everyone

	  The file has to be owned by user root, group root and has to be
	  writeable only by root:
	        (chown 0.0 /etc/busybox.conf; chmod 600 /etc/busybox.conf)
	  The busybox executable has to be owned by user root, group
	  root and has to be setuid root for this to work:
	        (chown 0.0 /bin/busybox; chmod 4755 /bin/busybox)

	bool "Suppress warning message if /etc/busybox.conf is not readable"
	default n
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SUID_CONFIG
	help
	  /etc/busybox.conf should be readable by the user needing the SUID, check
	  this option to avoid users to be notified about missing permissions.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SELINUX
	bool "Support NSA Security Enhanced Linux"
	default n
	help
	  Enable support for SELinux in applets ls, ps, and id.  Also provide
	  the option of compiling in SELinux applets.

	  If you do not have a complete SELinux userland installed, this stuff
	  will not compile. Go visit
		http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/index.html
	  to download the necessary stuff to allow busybox to compile with
	  this option enabled. Specifially, libselinux 1.28 or better is
	  directly required by busybox. If the installation is located in a
	  non-standard directory, provide it by invoking make as follows:
		CFLAGS=-I<libselinux-include-path> \
		LDFLAGS=-L<libselinux-lib-path> \
		make

	  Most people will leave this set to 'N'.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_PREFER_APPLETS
	bool "exec prefers applets"
	default y
	help
	  This is an experimental option which directs applets about to
	  call 'exec' to try and find an applicable busybox applet before
	  searching the PATH. This is typically done by exec'ing
	  /proc/self/exe.
	  This may affect shell, find -exec, xargs and similar applets.
	  They will use applets even if /bin/<applet> -> busybox link
	  is missing (or is not a link to busybox). However, this causes
	  problems in chroot jails without mounted /proc and with ps/top
	  (command name can be shown as 'exe' for applets started this way).

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_BUSYBOX_EXEC_PATH
	string "Path to BusyBox executable"
	default "/proc/self/exe"
	help
	  When Busybox applets need to run other busybox applets, BusyBox
	  sometimes needs to exec() itself.  When the /proc filesystem is
	  mounted, /proc/self/exe always points to the currently running
	  executable.  If you haven't got /proc, set this to wherever you
	  want to run BusyBox from.

# These are auto-selected by other options

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SYSLOG
	bool "Support for logging to syslog"
	default y
	help
	  This option is auto-selected when you select any applet which may
	  send its output to syslog. You do not need to select it manually.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_HAVE_RPC
	bool "RPC support"
	default y
	help
	  This is automatically selected if any of enabled applets need it.
	  You do not need to select it manually.

	default n
	help
	  If you want to build a static BusyBox binary, which does not
	  use or require any shared libraries, then enable this option.
	  This can cause BusyBox to be considerably larger, so you should
	  leave this option false unless you have a good reason (i.e.
	  your target platform does not support shared libraries, or
	  you are building an initrd which doesn't need anything but
	  BusyBox, etc).

	  Most people will leave this set to 'N'.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_NOMMU
	bool "Force NOMMU build"
	default n
	help
	  Busybox tries to detect whether architecture it is being
	  built against supports MMU or not. If this detection fails,
	  or if you want to build NOMMU version of busybox for testing,
	  you may force NOMMU build here.

	  Most people will leave this set to 'N'.

	help
	  Build a shared library libbusybox.so.N.N.N which contains all
	  busybox code.

	  This feature allows every applet to be built as a tiny
	  separate executable.  Enabling it for "one big busybox binary"
	  approach serves no purpose and increases code size.
	  You should almost certainly say "no" to this.

### config FEATURE_FULL_LIBBUSYBOX
###	bool "Feature-complete libbusybox"
###	default n if !FEATURE_SHARED_BUSYBOX
###	depends on BUILD_LIBBUSYBOX
###	help
###	  Build a libbusybox with the complete feature-set, disregarding
###	  the actually selected config.
###
###	  Normally, libbusybox will only contain the features which are
###	  used by busybox itself. If you plan to write a separate
###	  standalone application which uses libbusybox say 'Y'.
###
###	  Note: libbusybox is GPL, not LGPL, and exports no stable API that
###	  might act as a copyright barrier.  We can and will modify the
###	  exported function set between releases (even minor version number
###	  changes), and happily break out-of-tree features.
###
###	  Say 'N' if in doubt.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_INDIVIDUAL
	bool "Produce a binary for each applet, linked against libbusybox"
	default n

	help
	  If your CPU architecture doesn't allow for sharing text/rodata
	  sections of running binaries, but allows for runtime dynamic
	  libraries, this option will allow you to reduce memory footprint
	  when you have many different applets running at once.

	  If your CPU architecture allows for sharing text/rodata,
	  having single binary is more optimal.

	  Each applet will be a tiny program, dynamically linked
	  against libbusybox.so.N.N.N.

	  You need to have a working dynamic linker.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SHARED_BUSYBOX
	bool "Produce additional busybox binary linked against libbusybox"
	default n
	depends on !BUSYBOX_CONFIG_STATIC && BUSYBOX_CONFIG_BUILD_LIBBUSYBOX
	help
	  Build busybox, dynamically linked against libbusybox.so.N.N.N.

	  You need to have a working dynamic linker.

### config BUILD_AT_ONCE
###	bool "Compile all sources at once"
###	default n
###	help
###	  Normally each source-file is compiled with one invocation of
###	  the compiler.
###	  If you set this option, all sources are compiled at once.
###	  This gives the compiler more opportunities to optimize which can
###	  result in smaller and/or faster binaries.
###
###	  Setting this option will consume alot of memory, e.g. if you
###	  enable all applets with all features, gcc uses more than 300MB
###	  RAM during compilation of busybox.
###
###	  This option is most likely only beneficial for newer compilers
###	  such as gcc-4.1 and above.
###
###	  Say 'N' unless you know what you are doing.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LFS
	bool
	default y
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FDISK_SUPPORT_LARGE_DISKS
	help
	  If you want to build BusyBox with large file support, then enable
	  this option.  This will have no effect if your kernel or your C
	  library lacks large file support for large files.  Some of the
	  programs that can benefit from large file support include dd, gzip,
	  cp, mount, tar, and many others.  If you want to access files larger
	  than 2 Gigabytes, enable this option.  Otherwise, leave it set to 'N'.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILER_PREFIX

	  If you want to build BusyBox with a cross compiler, then you
	  will need to set this to the cross-compiler prefix, for example,
	  "i386-uclibc-". Note that CROSS_COMPILE environment variable
	  or "make CROSS_COMPILE=xxx ..." will override this selection.

	  Most people should answer N.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_DEBUG_PESSIMIZE
	bool "Disable compiler optimizations."
	default n
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_DEBUG
	help
	  The compiler's optimization of source code can eliminate and reorder

choice
	prompt "Additional debugging library"

	help
	  Using an additional debugging library will make BusyBox become
	  considerable larger and will cause it to run more slowly.  You
	  should always leave this option disabled for production use.

	  dmalloc support:
	  ----------------
	  This enables compiling with dmalloc ( http://dmalloc.com/ )
	  which is an excellent public domain mem leak and malloc problem
	  detector.  To enable dmalloc, before running busybox you will
	  want to properly set your environment, for example:
	    export DMALLOC_OPTIONS=debug=0x34f47d83,inter=100,log=logfile
	  The 'debug=' value is generated using the following command
	    dmalloc -p log-stats -p log-non-free -p log-bad-space -p log-elapsed-time \
	       -p check-fence -p check-heap -p check-lists -p check-blank \
	       -p check-funcs -p realloc-copy -p allow-free-null

	  Electric-fence support:
	  -----------------------
	  This enables compiling with Electric-fence support.  Electric
	  fence is another very useful malloc debugging library which uses
	  your computer's virtual memory hardware to detect illegal memory
	  accesses.  This support will make BusyBox be considerable larger
	  and run slower, so you should leave this option disabled unless
	  you are hunting a hard to find memory problem.
