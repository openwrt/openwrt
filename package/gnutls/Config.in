	  GnuTLS is a project that aims to develop a library which provides a 
	  secure layer, over a reliable transport layer. Currently the GnuTLS 
	  library implements the proposed standards by the IETF's TLS working 
	  group.
	  
	  Quoting from RFC2246 - the TLS 1.0 protocol specification:
	  
	  "The TLS protocol provides communications privacy over the Internet.
	   The protocol allows client/server applications to communicate in a 
	   way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message 
	   forgery."
	  
	  Features
	  
	    * Support for TLS 1.1 and SSL 3.0 protocols
	    * Support for TLS extensions
	    * Support for authentication using the SRP protocol
	    * Support for authentication using both X.509 certificates
	    * and OpenPGP keys Support for X.509 and OpenPGP certificate handling.
	    * Supports all the strong encryption algorithms

	  This packages contains the GnuTLS shared libraries, needed by other programs.
