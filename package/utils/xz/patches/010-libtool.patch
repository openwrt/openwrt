# Fix shared library building in XZ Utils 5.2.13, 5.4.7, and 5.6.2
#
# The releases were made with a development version of GNU Libtool
# (2.5.0+1+g38c166c8). The benefit is that there tend to be fixes that
# aren't in a stable release yet. At the same time there is a higher
# risk of new bugs. Unfortunately there was a bug that breaks building
# of shared libraries on some systems like mips64.
#
# This patch was made by taking the upstream commit to m4/libtool.m4
# and then running "autoconf" to update the generated "configure".
# This patch only modifies "configure" so that the changed timestamps
# won't cause the build system to regenerate more files, which would
# only work if one has all Autotools packages installed.
