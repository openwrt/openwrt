  bool "CTR, Counter mode"
  default y
  help
    Enable CTR mode (recommended).
    
    Counter mode converts a block cipher into a stream cipher
    by adding a simple incrementing counter to prevent generating
    identical ciphertext from identical plaintext data.
    As the counter value is predictable, blocks can be processed
    in parallel on multi-core CPUs.
    The usage of a simple deterministic input function used to be controversial;
    critics argued that "deliberately exposing a cryptosystem to a known
    systematic input represents an unnecessary risk". However, today, CTR mode
    is widely accepted, and any problems are considered a weakness of the underlying
    block cipher, which is expected to be secure regardless of systematic bias in its input.
   
    CTR does not protect against accidental or malicious data modification - a MAC is required.

config DROPBEAR_ENABLE_CBC_MODE
  bool "CBC, Cipher Block Chaining mode (weak)"
  default n
  help
    Enable CBC mode (not recommended).
    
    In CBC mode, each block of plaintext is XORed with the previous ciphertext block
    before being encrypted. This way, each ciphertext block depends on all plaintext blocks
    processed up to that point.
    XOR is a fast function, but this mode cannot be parallelized,
    as each block depends on the previous cyphertext.
    
    This mode is susceptible to ciphertext stealing and padding attacks.

config DROPBEAR_ENABLE_GCM_MODE
  bool "GCM, Galois-Counter mode (weak)"
  default n
  help

    GCM combines CTR mode with GMAC (Galois Message Authentication Code).
    It preserves parallelism capabilities of CTR, but GMAC is slow
    on CPUs without GHASH instructions.
    
    The authentication part of the GCM can be attacked by ciphertext forgery.

    Diffie-Hellman group16 provides a greater strength level
    but it is slower and increases binary size.

    Curve25519 and ECDH algorithms are faster than non-elliptic-curve methods.
    Small systems should generally include either Curve25519 or ECDH for performance.
    
    Compiling in ECC code (either ECDSA or ECDH) increases binary size - around 30kB on x86-64.

    Curve25519 and ECDH algorithms are faster than non-elliptic-curve methods.
    Curve25519 is less widely supported but faster than ECDH.
    
    Curve25519 increases binary size by ~2,5kB on x86-64.
