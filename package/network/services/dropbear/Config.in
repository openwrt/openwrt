	help
		This option itself doesn't enable any support for U2F/FIDO
		but subordinate options do:

		- DROPBEAR_ECDSA_SK   - ecdsa-sk keys support
		  depends on DROPBEAR_ECC ("Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)")
		- DROPBEAR_ED25519_SK - ed25519-sk keys support
		  depends on DROPBEAR_ED25519 ("Ed25519 support")

		This enables dropbear utmp support, the file /var/run/utmp is
		used to track who is currently logged in.

config DROPBEAR_PUTUTLINE
	bool "Pututline support"
	depends on DROPBEAR_UTMP
	help
		Dropbear will use pututline() to write the utmp structure into
		the utmp file.

config DROPBEAR_DBCLIENT_AGENTFORWARD
	bool "Enable agent forwarding in dbclient [LEGACY/SECURITY]"
	default y
	depends on DROPBEAR_DBCLIENT
	help
		Increases binary size by about 0.1 kB (MIPS).

		Security notes:

		SSH agent forwarding might cause security issues (locally and
		on the jump machine).

		Hovewer, it's enabled by default for compatibility with
		previous OpenWrt/dropbear releases.

		Consider DISABLING this option if you're building own OpenWrt
		image.

		Also see DROPBEAR_AGENTFORWARD (agent forwarding in dropbear
		server itself).

	default y
	help
		Increases binary size by about 0.1 kB (MIPS).

		Security notes:

		SSH agent forwarding might cause security issues (locally and
		on the jump machine).

		Hovewer, it's enabled by default for compatibility with
		previous OpenWrt/dropbear releases.

		Consider DISABLING this option if you're building own OpenWrt
		image.

		Also see DROPBEAR_DBCLIENT_AGENTFORWARD (agent forwarding in
		dropbear client) if DROPBEAR_DBCLIENT is selected.

config DROPBEAR_MODERN_ONLY
	bool "Use modern crypto only [BREAKS COMPATIBILITY]"

		 - RSA
		 - SHA1

		Reduces binary size by about 64 kB (MIPS) from default
		configuration.

		Consider enabling this option if you're building own OpenWrt
		image and using modern SSH software everywhere.
