Subject: [PATCH] P2P: Fix copying of secondary device types for P2P group
 client

Parsing and copying of WPS secondary device types list was verifying
that the contents is not too long for the internal maximum in the case
of WPS messages, but similar validation was missing from the case of P2P
group information which encodes this information in a different
attribute. This could result in writing beyond the memory area assigned
for these entries and corrupting memory within an instance of struct
p2p_device. This could result in invalid operations and unexpected
behavior when trying to free pointers from that corrupted memory.
