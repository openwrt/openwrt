Subject: [PATCH] AP: don't ignore probe-requests with invalid DSSS params

Don't ignore probe requests which contain an invalid DS parameter for the
current operating channel.

As the comment outlines, the drop shall only apply if
dot11RadioMeasurementActivated is set to 1.

However, it was observed Linux clients (Debian 12 / NixOS 23.11)
with an Intel 8265 NIC may generate a probe request frame with
dot11RadioMeasurementActivated set to false and an invalid DSSS
parameter.

These were also dropped even though they should not have been. They
however should not have contained this parameter in the first place.

Don't drop Probe Requests which contain such an invalid field. This may
lead to more probe responses being sent, however it does fix very
frequent connection issues for these clients on 2.4 GHz.
