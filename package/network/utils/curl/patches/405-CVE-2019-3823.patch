Subject: [PATCH] smtp: avoid risk of buffer overflow in strtol

If the incoming len 5, but the buffer does not have a termination
after 5 bytes, the strtol() call may keep reading through the line
buffer until is exceeds its boundary. Fix by ensuring that we are
using a bounded read with a temporary buffer on the stack.
