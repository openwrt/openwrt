# Example wpa_supplicant build time configuration
#
# This file lists the configuration options that are used when building the
# hostapd binary. All lines starting with # are ignored. Configuration option
# lines must be commented out complete, if they are not to be included, i.e.,
# just setting VARIABLE=n is not disabling that variable.
#
# This file is included in Makefile, so variables like CFLAGS and LIBS can also
# be modified from here. In most cases, these lines should use += in order not
# to override previous values of the variables.

# or GnuTLS in non-default location

# Add support for loading EAP methods dynamically as shared libraries.
# When this option is enabled, each EAP method can be either included
# statically (CONFIG_EAP_<method>=y) or dynamically (CONFIG_EAP_<method>=dyn).
# Dynamic EAP methods are build as shared objects (eap_*.so) and they need to
# be loaded in the beginning of the wpa_supplicant configuration file
# (see load_dynamic_eap parameter in the example file) before being used in
# the network blocks.
#
# Note that some shared parts of EAP methods are included in the main program
# and in order to be able to use dynamic EAP methods using these parts, the
# main program must have been build with the EAP method enabled (=y or =dyn).
# This means that EAP-TLS/PEAP/TTLS/FAST cannot be added as dynamic libraries
# unless at least one of them was included in the main build to force inclusion
# of the shared code. Similarly, at least one of EAP-SIM/AKA must be included
# in the main build to be able to load these methods dynamically.
