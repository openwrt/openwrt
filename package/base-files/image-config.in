menuconfig PREINITOPT
	bool "Preinit configuration options" if IMAGEOPT
	default n
	help
		These options are used to control the environment used to initialize
		the system before running init (which typically mean /sbin/init which
		switches to multiuser mode).

config TARGET_PREINIT_SUPPRESS_STDERR
	bool "Suppress stderr messages during preinit" if PREINITOPT
	default y
	help
		Sends stderr to null during preinit.  This is the default behaviour
		in previous versions of OpenWrt.  This also prevents init process
		itself from displaying stderr, however processes launched by init
		in multiuser through inittab will use the current terminal (e.g.
		the ash shell launched by inittab will display stderr).  That's
		the same behaviour as seen in previous version of OpenWrt.

config TARGET_PREINIT_TIMEOUT
	int
	prompt "Failsafe wait timeout" if PREINITOPT
	default 2
	help
		How long to wait for failsafe mode to be entered before
		continuing with a regular boot if failsafe not selected.

config TARGET_PREINIT_SHOW_NETMSG
	bool
	prompt "Show all preinit network messages" if PREINITOPT
	default n
	help
		Show preinit all network messages (via netmsg broadcast), not only
		the message indicating to press reset to enter failsafe.  Note that
		if the architecture doesn't define an interface, and there is no
		'Preinit network interface' defined, then no messages will be
		emitted, even if this is set.

config TARGET_PREINIT_SUPPRESS_FAILSAFE_NETMSG
	bool
	prompt "Suppress network message indicating failsafe" if PREINITOPT
	default n
	help
		If "Show all preinit network messages" above is not set, then
		setting this option suppresses the only message that would be
		emitted otherwise, name the network message to enter failsafe
		(via netmsg).

config TARGET_PREINIT_IFNAME
	string
	prompt "Preinit network interface" if PREINITOPT
	default ""
	help

		default networking in failsafe or preinit.  If empty
		uses $ifname (if defined in /etc/preinit.arch).

		messages, including failsafes messages

config TARGET_PREINIT_BROADCAST
	string
	prompt "Broadcast address for preinit network messages" if PREINITOPT
	default "192.168.1.255"

		Broadcast address to which to send preinit network messages, as
		as failsafe messages


menuconfig INITOPT
	bool "Init configuration options" if IMAGEOPT
	default n
	help
		These option choose the command that will run as the 'init' command
		(that is which is responsible for controlling the system once preinit
		transfers control to it) as well as some options controlling its
		behaviour.  Normally init is /sbin/init.

	config TARGET_INIT_PATH

			Default PATH used during normal operation

			Should be a space seperated list of variable assignments.  These
			variables will be present in the environment.  Spaces may not be
			present (including through expansion) even in a quoted string
			(env doesn't understanding quoting).

	config TARGET_INIT_CMD
		string
		prompt "Init command" if INITOPT

	config TARGET_INIT_SUPPRESS_STDERR
		bool
		prompt "Suppress stderr messages of init" if INITOPT
		default y
		help
			Prevents showing stderr messages for init command if not already
			suppressed during preinit.  This is the default behaviour in
			previous versions of OpenWrt.  Removing this does nothing if
			stderr is suppressed during preinit (which is the default).


menuconfig VERSIONOPT
	bool "Version configuration options" if IMAGEOPT
	default n
	help
		These options allow to override the version information embedded in
		the /etc/openwrt_version, /etc/openwrt_release, /etc/banner and
		/etc/opkg.conf files. Usually there is no need to set these, but
		they're useful for release builds or custom OpenWrt redistributions
		that should carry custom version tags.
