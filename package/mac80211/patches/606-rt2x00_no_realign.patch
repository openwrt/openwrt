[RFC] rt2x00: For drivers that only need L2 padding don't realign frames

Ivo, Gertjan, do you remeber by any chance why this alignment stuff was added
in the first place? Was it because of DMA restrictions?

While doing some profiling on the rt3052 SoC I noticed that 30-40% time was
spent in memmove calls. And the culprit is the memmove aligning the payload
to a 4byte boundary since that has to move a whole bunch of data.

Interesstingly the legacy drivers insert an l2pad between the header and the
payload but doesn't realign the payload itself to a 4-byte boundary. Hence,
I came up with this patch and indeed CPU usage improves impressively.

Only tested on rt2800pci!

Thanks,
Helmut
