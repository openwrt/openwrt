 -----------------------------------------------------

This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution.

To build your own firmware you need a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system (case
sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin is unsupported because of the lack
of a case sensitive file system.

You need gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make, find, grep, diff,
unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers installed.

1. Run "./scripts/feeds update -a" to obtain all the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default

2. Run "./scripts/feeds install -a" to install symlinks for all obtained
packages into package/feeds/

3. Run "make menuconfig" to select your preferred configuration for the
toolchain, target system & firmware packages.

4. Run "make" to build your firmware. This will download all sources, build
the cross-compile toolchain and then cross-compile the Linux kernel & all
chosen applications for your target system.
