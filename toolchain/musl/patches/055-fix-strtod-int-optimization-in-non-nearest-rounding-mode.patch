Subject: fix strtod int optimization in non-nearest rounding mode

the mid-sized integer optimization relies on lnz set up properly
to mark the last non-zero decimal digit, but this was not done
if the non-zero digit lied outside the KMAX digits of the base
10^9 number representation.

so if the fractional part was a very long list of zeros (>2048*9 on
x86) followed by non-zero digits then the integer optimization could
kick in discarding the tiny non-zero fraction which can mean wrong
result on non-nearest rounding mode.

strtof, strtod and strtold were all affected.
