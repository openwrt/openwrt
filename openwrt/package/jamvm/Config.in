          JamVM is a new Java Virtual Machine which conforms to the JVM specification version
          (blue book). In comparison to most other VM's (free and commercial) it is extremely
          small.However, unlike other small VMs (e.g. KVM) it is designed to support the full
          specification, and includes support for object finalisation, Soft/Weak/Phantom 
	  References, the Java Native Interface (JNI) and the Reflection API.
