	  Tor is a toolset for a wide range of organizations and people that want
	  to improve their safety and security on the Internet. Using Tor can 
	  help you anonymize web browsing and publishing, instant messaging, 
	  IRC, SSH, and more. Tor also provides a platform on which software 
	  developers can build new applications with built-in anonymity, safety, 
	  and privacy features.
