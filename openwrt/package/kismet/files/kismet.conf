# Kismet config file
# Most of the "static" configs have been moved to here -- the command line
# config was getting way too crowded and cryptic.  We want functionality,
# not continually reading --help!

# Version of Kismet config
version=2005.01.R1

# Name of server (Purely for organiational purposes)
servername=Kismet

# User to setid to (should be your normal user)
suiduser=nobody

# Sources are defined as:
# source=cardtype,interface,name[,initialchannel]
# Card types and required drivers are listed in the README.
# The initial channel is optional, if hopping is not enabled it can be used
# to set the channel the interface listens on.
# YOU MUST CHANGE THIS TO BE THE SOURCE YOU WANT TO USE
source=wrt54g,eth1,wireless
# For v1 hardware uncomment this:
# source=wrt54g,eth2,wireless

# Comma-separated list of sources to enable.  This is only needed if you defined
# multiple sources and only want to enable some of them.  By default, all defined
# sources are enabled.
# For example:
# enablesources=prismsource,ciscosource

# Do we channelhop?
channelhop=true

# How many channels per second do we hop?  (1-10)
channelvelocity=5

# By setting the dwell time for channel hopping we override the channelvelocity
# setting above and dwell on each channel for the given number of seconds.
#channeldwell=10

# Do we split channels between cards on the same spectrum?  This means if 
# multiple 802.11b capture sources are defined, they will be offset to cover
# the most possible spectrum at a given time.  This also controls splitting
# fine-tuned sourcechannels lines which cover multiple interfaces (see below)
channelsplit=true

# Basic channel hopping control:
# These define the channels the cards hop through for various frequency ranges
# supported by Kismet.   More finegrain control is available via the 
# "sourcechannels" configuration option.
# 
# Don't change the IEEE80211<x> identifiers or channel hopping won't work.

# Users outside the US might want to use this list:
# defaultchannels=IEEE80211b:1,7,13,2,8,3,14,9,4,10,5,11,6,12
defaultchannels=IEEE80211b:1,6,11,2,7,3,8,4,9,5,10

# 802.11g uses the same channels as 802.11b...
defaultchannels=IEEE80211g:1,6,11,2,7,3,8,4,9,5,10

# 802.11a channels are non-overlapping so sequential is fine.  You may want to
# adjust the list depending on the channels your card actually supports.
# defaultchannels=IEEE80211a:36,40,44,48,52,56,60,64,100,104,108,112,116,120,124,128,132,136,140,149,153,157,161,184,188,192,196,200,204,208,212,216 
defaultchannels=IEEE80211a:36,40,44,48,52,56,60,64

# Combo cards like Atheros use both 'a' and 'b/g' channels.  Of course, you
# can also explicitly override a given source.  You can use the script 
# extras/listchan.pl to extract all the channels your card supports.
defaultchannels=IEEE80211ab:1,6,11,2,7,3,8,4,9,5,10,36,40,44,48,52,56,60,64

# Fine-tuning channel hopping control:
# The sourcechannels option can be used to set the channel hopping for 
# specific interfaces, and to control what interfaces share a list of 
# channels for split hopping.  This can also be used to easily lock
# one card on a single channel while hopping with other cards.
# Any card without a sourcechannel definition will use the standard hopping
# list.
# sourcechannels=sourcename[,sourcename]:ch1,ch2,ch3,...chN

# ie, for us channels on the source 'prism2source' (same as normal channel
# hopping behavior):
# sourcechannels=prism2source:1,6,11,2,7,3,8,4,9,5,10

# Given two capture sources, "prism2a" and "prism2b", we want prism2a to stay
# on channel 6 and prism2b to hop normally.  By not setting a sourcechannels 
# line for prism2b, it will use the standard hopping.
# sourcechannels=prism2a:6

# To assign the same custom hop channel to multiple sources, or to split the 
# same custom hop channel over two sources (if splitchannels is true), list
# them all on the same sourcechannels line:
# sourcechannels=prism2a,prism2b,prism2c:1,6,11

# Packet filtering options:
# filter_tracker - Packets filtered from the tracker are not processed or
#                  recorded in any way.
# filter_dump    - Packets filtered at the dump level are tracked, displayed,
#                  and written to the csv/xml/network/etc files, but not 
#                  recorded in the packet dump
# filter_export  - Controls what packets influence the exported CSV, network,
#                  xml, gps, etc files.
# All filtering options take arguments containing the type of address and
# addresses to be filtered.  Valid address types are 'ANY', 'BSSID',
# 'SOURCE', and 'DEST'.  Filtering can be inverted by the use of '!' before
# the address.  For example,
# filter_tracker=ANY(!00:00:DE:AD:BE:EF)
# has the same effect as the previous mac_filter config file option.
# filter_tracker=...
# filter_dump=...
# filter_export=...

# Alerts to be reported and the throttling rates.
# alert=name,throttle/unit,burst
# The throttle/unit describes the number of alerts of this type that are
# sent per time unit.  Valid time units are second, minute, hour, and day.
# Burst describes the number of alerts sent before throttling takes place.
# For example:
# alert=FOO,10/min,5
# Would allow 5 alerts through before throttling is enabled, and will then
# limit the number of alerts to 10 per minute.
# A throttle rate of 0 disables throttling of the alert.
# See the README for a list of alert types.
