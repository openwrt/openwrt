	  As its name suggests, picocom is a minimal dumb-terminal emulation 
	  program. It is, in principle, very much like minicom, only it's pico 
	  instead of mini! It was designed to serve as a simple, manual, modem 
	  configuration, testing, and debugging tool. It has also served (quite 
	  well) as a low-tech "terminal-window" to allow operator intervention 
	  in PPP connection scripts. It could also prove useful in many other 
	  similar tasks.
