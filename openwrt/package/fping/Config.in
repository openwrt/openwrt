	  fping is a ping(1) like program which uses the Internet Control Message Protocol
	  (ICMP) echo request to determine if a host is up. fping is different from ping in
	  that you can specify any number of hosts on the command line, or specify a file
	  containing the lists of hosts to ping. Instead of trying one host until it timeouts
	  or replies, fping will send out a ping packet and move on to the next host in a
	  round-robin fashion. If a host replies, it is noted and removed from the list of 
	  hosts to check. If a host does not respond within a certain time limit and/or retry
	  limit it will be considered unreachable.
