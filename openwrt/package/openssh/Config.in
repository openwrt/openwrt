	  OpenSSH is a FREE version of the SSH protocol suite of network 
	  connectivity tools that increasing numbers of people on the Internet 
	  are coming to rely on. Many users of telnet, rlogin, ftp, and other 
	  such programs might not realize that their password is transmitted 
	  across the Internet unencrypted, but it is. OpenSSH encrypts all 
	  traffic (including passwords) to effectively eliminate eavesdropping, 
	  connection hijacking, and other network-level attacks. Additionally, 
	  OpenSSH provides a myriad of secure tunneling capabilities, as well 
	  as a variety of authentication methods.
