The WiFi settings are configured in the file \texttt{/etc/config/wireless}
(currently supported on Broadcom and Atheros). When booting the router for the first time
it should detect your card and create a sample configuration file. By default '\texttt{option network  lan}' is
commented. This prevents unsecured sharing of the network over the wireless interface.

\paragraph{Generic Broadcom wireless config:}

\begin{Verbatim}
config wifi-device      "wl0"
    option type         "broadcom"
    option channel      "5"

    option ssid         "OpenWrt"
    option hidden       "0"

\end{Verbatim}

\paragraph{Generic Atheros wireless config:}

\begin{Verbatim}

There are two types of config sections in this file. The '\texttt{wifi-device}' refers to
the physical wifi interface and '\texttt{wifi-iface}' configures a virtual interface on top
of that (if supported by the driver).

\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Limitations:}

There are certain limitations when combining modes.
Only the following mode combinations are supported:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Broadcom}: \\
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 1x \texttt{sta}, 0-3x \texttt{ap}
            \item 1-4x \texttt{ap}
            \item 1x \texttt{adhoc}
        \end{itemize}

        WDS links can only be used in pure AP mode and cannot use WEP (except when sharing the
        settings with the master interface, which is done automatically).

    \item \textbf{Atheros}: \\
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 1x \texttt{sta}, 0-4x \texttt{ap}
            \item 1-4x \texttt{ap}
            \item 1x \texttt{adhoc}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
