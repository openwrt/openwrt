	  This is essentially a stripped-down version of the buildroot
	  with precompiled packages, kernel image and image building tools.
	  You can use it to generate custom images without compiling anything

config IB_STANDALONE
	bool "Include package repositories"
	default y if !BUILDBOT
	depends on IB
	help
	  Disabling this option will cause the ImageBuilder to embed only
	  toolchain and kmod packages while all other ipk archives will be
	  fetched from online repositories.

config IB_BUILD_SELECTED_PROFILES_ONLY
	bool "Build selected target profiles only"
	default n
	depends on IB
	help
	  Enabling this will build the ImageBuilder with kernel images
	  for selected target profiles (devices) only. This could speed up
	  the build significantly if the ImageBuilder will be used to target
	  only the limited number of devices.
