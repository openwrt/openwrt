Subject: [PATCH 5005/5006] arm64: dts: allwinner: h616: OrangePi Zero 2: Add
 USB nodes

The OrangePi Zero 2 has one USB-A host port, VBUS is provided by
a GPIO controlled regulator.
The USB-C port is meant to power the board, but is also connected to
the USB 0 port, which we configure as an MUSB peripheral.
