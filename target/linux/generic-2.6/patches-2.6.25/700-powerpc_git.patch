+VII - Marvell Discovery mv64[345]6x System Controller chips
+===========================================================
+
+The Marvell mv64[345]60 series of system controller chips contain
+many of the peripherals needed to implement a complete computer
+system.  In this section, we define device tree nodes to describe
+the system controller chip itself and each of the peripherals
+which it contains.  Compatible string values for each node are
+prefixed with the string "marvell,", for Marvell Technology Group Ltd.
+
+1) The /system-controller node
+
+  This node is used to represent the system-controller and must be
+  present when the system uses a system contller chip. The top-level
+  system-controller node contains information that is global to all
+  devices within the system controller chip. The node name begins
+  with "system-controller" followed by the unit address, which is
+  the base address of the memory-mapped register set for the system
+  controller chip.
+
+  Required properties:
+
+    - ranges : Describes the translation of system controller addresses
+      for memory mapped registers.
+    - clock-frequency: Contains the main clock frequency for the system
+      controller chip.
+    - reg : This property defines the address and size of the
+      memory-mapped registers contained within the system controller
+      chip.  The address specified in the "reg" property should match
+      the unit address of the system-controller node.
+    - #address-cells : Address representation for system controller
+      devices.  This field represents the number of cells needed to
+      represent the address of the memory-mapped registers of devices
+      within the system controller chip.
+    - #size-cells : Size representation for for the memory-mapped
+      registers within the system controller chip.
+    - #interrupt-cells : Defines the width of cells used to represent
+      interrupts.
+
+  Optional properties:
+
+    - model : The specific model of the system controller chip.  Such
+      as, "mv64360", "mv64460", or "mv64560".
+    - compatible : A string identifying the compatibility identifiers
+      of the system controller chip.
+
+  The system-controller node contains child nodes for each system
+  controller device that the platform uses.  Nodes should not be created
+  for devices which exist on the system controller chip but are not used
+
+  Example Marvell Discovery mv64360 system-controller node:
+
+    system-controller@f1000000 { /* Marvell Discovery mv64360 */
+	    #address-cells = <1>;
+	    #size-cells = <1>;
+	    model = "mv64360";                      /* Default */
+	    compatible = "marvell,mv64360";
+	    clock-frequency = <133333333>;
+	    reg = <0xf1000000 0x10000>;
+	    virtual-reg = <0xf1000000>;
+	    ranges = <0x88000000 0x88000000 0x1000000 /* PCI 0 I/O Space */
+		    0x80000000 0x80000000 0x8000000 /* PCI 0 MEM Space */
+		    0xa0000000 0xa0000000 0x4000000 /* User FLASH */
+		    0x00000000 0xf1000000 0x0010000 /* Bridge's regs */
+		    0xf2000000 0xf2000000 0x0040000>;/* Integrated SRAM */
+
+	    [ child node definitions... ]
+    }
+
+2) Child nodes of /system-controller
+
+   a) Marvell Discovery MDIO bus
+
+   The MDIO is a bus to which the PHY devices are connected.  For each
+   device that exists on this bus, a child node should be created.  See
+   the definition of the PHY node below for an example of how to define
+   a PHY.
+
+   Required properties:
+     - #address-cells : Should be <1>
+     - #size-cells : Should be <0>
+     - device_type : Should be "mdio"
+     - compatible : Should be "marvell,mv64360-mdio"
+
+   Example:

+
+	     ethernet-phy@0 {
+		     ......
+	     };
+     };
+
+
+   b) Marvell Discovery ethernet controller
+
+   The Discover ethernet controller is described with two levels
+   of nodes.  The first level describes an ethernet silicon block
+   and the second level describes up to 3 ethernet nodes within
+   that block.  The reason for the multiple levels is that the
+   registers for the node are interleaved within a single set
+   of registers.  The "ethernet-block" level describes the
+   shared register set, and the "ethernet" nodes describe ethernet
+   port-specific properties.

+       controller.
+     - local-mac-address : 6 bytes, MAC address
+
+   Example Discovery Ethernet port node:
+     ethernet@0 {
+	     device_type = "network";
+	     compatible = "marvell,mv64360-eth";
+	     reg = <0>;

+                   Hypervisor-Assisted Dump
+                   ------------------------
+                       November 2007
+
+The goal of hypervisor-assisted dump is to enable the dump of
+a crashed system, and to do so from a fully-reset system, and
+to minimize the total elapsed time until the system is back
+in production use.
+
+As compared to kdump or other strategies, hypervisor-assisted
+dump offers several strong, practical advantages:
+
+-- Unlike kdump, the system has been reset, and loaded
+   with a fresh copy of the kernel.  In particular,
+   PCI and I/O devices have been reinitialized and are
+   in a clean, consistent state.
+-- As the dump is performed, the dumped memory becomes
+   immediately available to the system for normal use.
+-- After the dump is completed, no further reboots are
+   required; the system will be fully usable, and running
+   in it's normal, production mode on it normal kernel.
+
+The above can only be accomplished by coordination with,
+and assistance from the hypervisor. The procedure is
+as follows:
+
+-- When a system crashes, the hypervisor will save
+   the low 256MB of RAM to a previously registered
+   save region. It will also save system state, system
+   registers, and hardware PTE's.
+
+-- After the low 256MB area has been saved, the
+   hypervisor will reset PCI and other hardware state.
+   It will *not* clear RAM. It will then launch the
+   bootloader, as normal.
+
+-- The freshly booted kernel will notice that there
+   is a new node (ibm,dump-kernel) in the device tree,
+   indicating that there is crash data available from
+   a previous boot. It will boot into only 256MB of RAM,
+   reserving the rest of system memory.
+
+-- Userspace tools will parse /sys/kernel/release_region
+   and read /proc/vmcore to obtain the contents of memory,
+   which holds the previous crashed kernel. The userspace
+   tools may copy this info to disk, or network, nas, san,
+   iscsi, etc. as desired.
+
+   For Example: the values in /sys/kernel/release-region
+   would look something like this (address-range pairs).
+   CPU:0x177fee000-0x10000: HPTE:0x177ffe020-0x1000: /
+   DUMP:0x177fff020-0x10000000, 0x10000000-0x16F1D370A
+
+-- As the userspace tools complete saving a portion of
+   dump, they echo an offset and size to
+   /sys/kernel/release_region to release the reserved
+   memory back to general use.
+
+   An example of this is:
+     "echo 0x40000000 0x10000000 > /sys/kernel/release_region"
+   which will release 256MB at the 1GB boundary.
+
+Please note that the hypervisor-assisted dump feature
+is only available on Power6-based systems with recent
+firmware versions.
+
+Implementation details:
+----------------------
+
+During boot, a check is made to see if firmware supports
+this feature on this particular machine. If it does, then
+we check to see if a active dump is waiting for us. If yes
+then everything but 256 MB of RAM is reserved during early
+boot. This area is released once we collect a dump from user
+land scripts that are run. If there is dump data, then
+the /sys/kernel/release_region file is created, and
+the reserved memory is held.
+
+If there is no waiting dump data, then only the highest
+256MB of the ram is reserved as a scratch area. This area
+is *not* released: this region will be kept permanently
+reserved, so that it can act as a receptacle for a copy
+of the low 256MB in the case a crash does occur. See,
+however, "open issues" below, as to whether
+such a reserved region is really needed.
+
+Currently the dump will be copied from /proc/vmcore to a
+a new file upon user intervention. The starting address
+to be read and the range for each data point in provided
+in /sys/kernel/release_region.
+
+The tools to examine the dump will be same as the ones
+used for kdump.
+
+General notes:
+--------------
+Security: please note that there are potential security issues
+with any sort of dump mechanism. In particular, plaintext
+(unencrypted) data, and possibly passwords, may be present in
+the dump data. Userspace tools must take adequate precautions to
+preserve security.
+
+Open issues/ToDo:
+------------
+ o The various code paths that tell the hypervisor that a crash
+   occurred, vs. it simply being a normal reboot, should be
+   reviewed, and possibly clarified/fixed.
+
+ o Instead of using /sys/kernel, should there be a /sys/dump
+   instead? There is a dump_subsys being created by the s390 code,
+   perhaps the pseries code should use a similar layout as well.
+
+ o Is reserving a 256MB region really required? The goal of
+   reserving a 256MB scratch area is to make sure that no
+   important crash data is clobbered when the hypervisor
+   save low mem to the scratch area. But, if one could assure
+   that nothing important is located in some 256MB area, then
+   it would not need to be reserved. Something that can be
+   improved in subsequent versions.
+
+ o Still working the kdump team to integrate this with kdump,
+   some work remains but this would not affect the current
+   patches.
+
+ o Still need to write a shell script, to copy the dump away.
+   Currently I am parsing it manually.
