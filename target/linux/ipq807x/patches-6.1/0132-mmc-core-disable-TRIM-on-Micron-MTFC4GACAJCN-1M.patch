Subject: [PATCH] mmc: core: disable TRIM on Micron MTFC4GACAJCN-1M

It seems that Micron MTFC4GACAJCN-1M despite advertising TRIM support does
not work when the core is trying to use REQ_OP_WRITE_ZEROES.

We are seeing the following errors in OpenWrt under 6.1 on Qnap Qhora 301W
that we did not previously have and tracked it down to REQ_OP_WRITE_ZEROES:
[   18.085950] I/O error, dev loop0, sector 596 op 0x9:(WRITE_ZEROES) flags 0x800 phys_seg 0 prio class 2

Disabling TRIM makes the error go away, so lets add a quirk for this eMMC
to disable TRIM.
