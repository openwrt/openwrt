Subject: [PATCH 033/116] PCI: Add PCIE_RESET_CONFIG_DEVICE_WAIT_MS waiting
 time value

Add the PCIE_RESET_CONFIG_DEVICE_WAIT_MS macro to define the minimum
waiting time between exit from a conventional reset and sending the
first configuration request to the device.

As described in PCI base specification r6.0, section 6.6.1 <Conventional
Reset>, there are two different use cases of the value:

   - "With a Downstream Port that does not support Link speeds greater
     than 5.0 GT/s, software must wait a minimum of 100 ms following exit
     from a Conventional Reset before sending a Configuration Request to
     the device immediately below that Port."

   - "With a Downstream Port that supports Link speeds greater than
     5.0 GT/s, software must wait a minimum of 100 ms after Link training
     completes before sending a Configuration Request to the device
     immediately below that Port."
