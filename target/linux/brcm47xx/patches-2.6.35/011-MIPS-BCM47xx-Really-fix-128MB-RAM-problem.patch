Subject: [PATCH 1/5] MIPS: BCM47xx: Really fix 128MB RAM problem

The previews patch 84a6fcb368a080620d12fc4d79e07902dbee7335 was wrong,
I got wrong success reports.

The bcm47xx architecture maps the ram into a 128MB address space. It
will be paced there as often as goes into the 128MB. The detection
tries to find the position where the same memory is found. When reading
over 128MB the processor will throw an exception. If 128MB ram is
installed, it will not find the same memory because it tries to read
over the 128MB boarder. Now it just assumes 128MB installed ram if it
can not find that the ram is repeating.
