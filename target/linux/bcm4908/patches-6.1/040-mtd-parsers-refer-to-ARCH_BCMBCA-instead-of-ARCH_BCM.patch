Subject: [PATCH] mtd: parsers: refer to ARCH_BCMBCA instead of ARCH_BCM4908

Commit dd5c672d7ca9 ("arm64: bcmbca: Merge ARCH_BCM4908 to ARCH_BCMBCA")
removes config ARCH_BCM4908 as config ARCH_BCMBCA has the same intent.

Probably due to concurrent development, commit 002181f5b150 ("mtd: parsers:
add Broadcom's U-Boot parser") introduces 'Broadcom's U-Boot partition
parser' that depends on ARCH_BCM4908, but this use was not visible during
the config refactoring from the commit above. Hence, these two changes
create a reference to a non-existing config symbol.

Adjust the MTD_BRCM_U_BOOT definition to refer to ARCH_BCMBCA instead of
ARCH_BCM4908 to remove the reference to the non-existing config symbol
ARCH_BCM4908.
