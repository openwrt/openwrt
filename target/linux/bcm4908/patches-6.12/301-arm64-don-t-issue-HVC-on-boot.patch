Subject: [PATCH] arm64: don't issue HVC on boot
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Broadcom's CFE loader seems to miss setting SCR_EL3.HCE which results in
generating an UNDEF and kernel panic on the first HVC.

HVC gets issued by kernels 5.12+ while booting, by kexec and KVM. Until
someone finds a workaround we have to avoid all above.

Workarounds: 0c93df9622d4 ("arm64: Initialise as nVHE before switching to VHE")
