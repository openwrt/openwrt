Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: bcm2835: remove unnecessary masking of dma
 channels

The original patch contained 3 dma channels that were masked out.

These - as far as research and discussions show - are a
artefacts remaining from the downstream legacy dma-api.

Right now down-stream still includes a legacy api used only
in a single (downstream only) driver (bcm2708_fb) that requires
2D DMA for speedup (DMA-channel 0).
Formerly the sd-card support driver also was using this legacy
api (DMA-channel 2), but since has been moved over to use
dmaengine directly.

The DMA-channel 3 is already masked out in the devicetree in
the default property "brcm,dma-channel-mask = <0x7f35>;"

So we can remove the whole masking of DMA channels.
