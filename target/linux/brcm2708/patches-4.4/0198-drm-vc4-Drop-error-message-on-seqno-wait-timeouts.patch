Subject: [PATCH] drm/vc4: Drop error message on seqno wait timeouts.

These ioctls end up getting exposed to userspace, and having normal
user requests print DRM errors is obviously wrong.  The message was
originally to give us some idea of what happened when a hang occurred,
but we have a DRM_INFO from reset for that.
