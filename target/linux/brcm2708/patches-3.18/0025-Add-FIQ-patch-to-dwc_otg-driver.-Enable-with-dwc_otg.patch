Subject: [PATCH 025/114] Add FIQ patch to dwc_otg driver. Enable with
 dwc_otg.fiq_fix_enable=1. Should give about 10% more ARM performance. Thanks
 to Gordon and Costas

Avoid dynamic memory allocation for channel lock in USB driver. Thanks ddv2005.

Add NAK holdoff scheme. Enabled by default, disable with dwc_otg.nak_holdoff_enable=0. Thanks gsh

Make sure we wait for the reset to finish

dwc_otg: fix bug in dwc_otg_hcd.c resulting in silent kernel
	 memory corruption, escalating to OOPS under high USB load.

dwc_otg: Fix unsafe access of QTD during URB enqueue

In dwc_otg_hcd_urb_enqueue during qtd creation, it was possible that the
transaction could complete almost immediately after the qtd was assigned
to a host channel during URB enqueue, which meant the qtd pointer was no
longer valid having been completed and removed. Usually, this resulted in
an OOPS during URB submission. By predetermining whether transactions
need to be queued or not, this unsafe pointer access is avoided.

This bug was only evident on the Pi model A where a device was attached
that had no periodic endpoints (e.g. USB pendrive or some wlan devices).

dwc_otg: Fix incorrect URB allocation error handling

If the memory allocation for a dwc_otg_urb failed, the kernel would OOPS
because for some reason a member of the *unallocated* struct was set to
zero. Error handling changed to fail correctly.

dwc_otg: fix potential use-after-free case in interrupt handler

If a transaction had previously aborted, certain interrupts are
enabled to track error counts and reset where necessary. On IN
endpoints the host generates an ACK interrupt near-simultaneously
with completion of transfer. In the case where this transfer had
previously had an error, this results in a use-after-free on
the QTD memory space with a 1-byte length being overwritten to
0x00.

dwc_otg: add handling of SPLIT transaction data toggle errors

Previously a data toggle error on packets from a USB1.1 device behind
a TT would result in the Pi locking up as the driver never handled
the associated interrupt. Patch adds basic retry mechanism and
interrupt acknowledgement to cater for either a chance toggle error or
for devices that have a broken initial toggle state (FT8U232/FT232BM).

dwc_otg: implement tasklet for returning URBs to usbcore hcd layer

The dwc_otg driver interrupt handler for transfer completion will spend
a very long time with interrupts disabled when a URB is completed -
this is because usb_hcd_giveback_urb is called from within the handler
which for a USB device driver with complicated processing (e.g. webcam)
will take an exorbitant amount of time to complete. This results in
missed completion interrupts for other USB packets which lead to them
being dropped due to microframe overruns.

This patch splits returning the URB to the usb hcd layer into a
high-priority tasklet. This will have most benefit for isochronous IN
transfers but will also have incidental benefit where multiple periodic
devices are active at once.

dwc_otg: fix NAK holdoff and allow on split transactions only

This corrects a bug where if a single active non-periodic endpoint
had at least one transaction in its qh, on frnum == MAX_FRNUM the qh
would get skipped and never get queued again. This would result in
a silent device until error detection (automatic or otherwise) would
either reset the device or flush and requeue the URBs.

Additionally the NAK holdoff was enabled for all transactions - this
would potentially stall a HS endpoint for 1ms if a previous error state
enabled this interrupt and the next response was a NAK. Fix so that
only split transactions get held off.

dwc_otg: Call usb_hcd_unlink_urb_from_ep with lock held in completion handler

usb_hcd_unlink_urb_from_ep must be called with the HCD lock held.  Calling it
asynchronously in the tasklet was not safe (regression in
c4564d4a1a0a9b10d4419e48239f5d99e88d2667).

This change unlinks it from the endpoint prior to queueing it for handling in
the tasklet, and also adds a check to ensure the urb is OK to be unlinked
before doing so.

NULL pointer dereference kernel oopses had been observed in usb_hcd_giveback_urb
when a USB device was unplugged/replugged during data transfer.  This effect
was reproduced using automated USB port power control, hundreds of replug
events were performed during active transfers to confirm that the problem was
eliminated.

USB fix using a FIQ to implement split transactions

This commit adds a FIQ implementaion that schedules
the split transactions using a FIQ so we don't get
held off by the interrupt latency of Linux

dwc_otg: fix device attributes and avoid kernel warnings on boot

dcw_otg: avoid logging function that can cause panics

See: https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/21
Thanks to cleverca22 for fix

dwc_otg: mask correct interrupts after transaction error recovery

The dwc_otg driver will unmask certain interrupts on a transaction
that previously halted in the error state in order to reset the
QTD error count. The various fine-grained interrupt handlers do not
consider that other interrupts besides themselves were unmasked.

By disabling the two other interrupts only ever enabled in DMA mode
for this purpose, we can avoid unnecessary function calls in the
IRQ handler. This will also prevent an unneccesary FIQ interrupt
from being generated if the FIQ is enabled.

dwc_otg: fiq: prevent FIQ thrash and incorrect state passing to IRQ

In the case of a transaction to a device that had previously aborted
due to an error, several interrupts are enabled to reset the error
count when a device responds. This has the side-effect of making the
FIQ thrash because the hardware will generate multiple instances of
a NAK on an IN bulk/interrupt endpoint and multiple instances of ACK
on an OUT bulk/interrupt endpoint. Make the FIQ mask and clear the
associated interrupts.

Additionally, on non-split transactions make sure that only unmasked
interrupts are cleared. This caused a hard-to-trigger but serious
race condition when you had the combination of an endpoint awaiting
error recovery and a transaction completed on an endpoint - due to
the sequencing and timing of interrupts generated by the dwc_otg core,
it was possible to confuse the IRQ handler.

Fix function tracing

dwc_otg: whitespace cleanup in dwc_otg_urb_enqueue

dwc_otg: prevent OOPSes during device disconnects

The dwc_otg_urb_enqueue function is thread-unsafe. In particular the
access of urb->hcpriv, usb_hcd_link_urb_to_ep, dwc_otg_urb->qtd and
friends does not occur within a critical section and so if a device
was unplugged during activity there was a high chance that the
usbcore hub_thread would try to disable the endpoint with partially-
formed entries in the URB queue. This would result in BUG() or null
pointer dereferences.

Fix so that access of urb->hcpriv, enqueuing to the hardware and
adding to usbcore endpoint URB lists is contained within a single
critical section.

dwc_otg: prevent BUG() in TT allocation if hub address is > 16

A fixed-size array is used to track TT allocation. This was
previously set to 16 which caused a crash because
dwc_otg_hcd_allocate_port would read past the end of the array.

This was hit if a hub was plugged in which enumerated as addr > 16,
due to previous device resets or unplugs.

Also add #ifdef FIQ_DEBUG around hcd->hub_port_alloc[], which grows
to a large size if 128 hub addresses are supported. This field is
for debug only for tracking which frame an allocate happened in.

dwc_otg: make channel halts with unknown state less damaging

If the IRQ received a channel halt interrupt through the FIQ
with no other bits set, the IRQ would not release the host
channel and never complete the URB.

Add catchall handling to treat as a transaction error and retry.

dwc_otg: fiq_split: use TTs with more granularity

This fixes certain issues with split transaction scheduling.

- Isochronous multi-packet OUT transactions now hog the TT until
  they are completed - this prevents hubs aborting transactions
  if they get a periodic start-split out-of-order
- Don't perform TT allocation on non-periodic endpoints - this
  allows simultaneous use of the TT's bulk/control and periodic
  transaction buffers

This commit will mainly affect USB audio playback.

dwc_otg: fix potential sleep while atomic during urb enqueue

Fixes a regression introduced with eb1b482a. Kmalloc called from
dwc_otg_hcd_qtd_add / dwc_otg_hcd_qtd_create did not always have
the GPF_ATOMIC flag set. Force this flag when inside the larger
critical section.

dwc_otg: make fiq_split_enable imply fiq_fix_enable

Failing to set up the FIQ correctly would result in
"IRQ 32: nobody cared" errors in dmesg.

dwc_otg: prevent crashes on host port disconnects

Fix several issues resulting in crashes or inconsistent state
if a Model A root port was disconnected.

- Clean up queue heads properly in kill_urbs_in_qh_list by
  removing the empty QHs from the schedule lists
- Set the halt status properly to prevent IRQ handlers from
  using freed memory
- Add fiq_split related cleanup for saved registers
- Make microframe scheduling reclaim host channels if
  active during a disconnect
- Abort URBs with -ESHUTDOWN status response, informing
  device drivers so they respond in a more correct fashion
  and don't try to resubmit URBs
- Prevent IRQ handlers from attempting to handle channel
  interrupts if the associated URB was dequeued (and the
  driver state was cleared)

dwc_otg: prevent leaking URBs during enqueue

A dwc_otg_urb would get leaked if the HCD enqueue function
failed for any reason. Free the URB at the appropriate points.

dwc_otg: Enable NAK holdoff for control split transactions

Certain low-speed devices take a very long time to complete a
data or status stage of a control transaction, producing NAK
responses until they complete internal processing - the USB2.0
spec limit is up to 500mS. This causes the same type of interrupt
storm as seen with USB-serial dongles prior to c8edb238.

In certain circumstances, usually while booting, this interrupt
storm could cause SD card timeouts.

dwc_otg: Fix for occasional lockup on boot when doing a USB reset

dwc_otg: Don't issue traffic to LS devices in FS mode

Issuing low-speed packets when the root port is in full-speed mode
causes the root port to stop responding. Explicitly fail when
enqueuing URBs to a LS endpoint on a FS bus.

Fix ARM architecture issue with local_irq_restore()

If local_fiq_enable() is called before a local_irq_restore(flags) where
the flags variable has the F bit set, the FIQ will be erroneously disabled.

Fixup arch_local_irq_restore to avoid trampling the F bit in CPSR.

Also fix some of the hacks previously implemented for previous dwc_otg
incarnations.
