	help
	  Support for the Sonics Silicon Backplane bus

	  The module will be called ssb

	  If unsure, say M

	  If unsure, say N

config SSB_SILENT
	bool "No SSB kernel messages"
	depends on SSB
	help
	  This option turns off all Sonics Silicon Backplane printks.
	  Note that you won't be able to identify problems, once
	  messages are turned off.
	  This might only be desired for production kernels on
	  embedded devices to reduce the kernel size.

	  Say N

config SSB_DEBUG
	bool "SSB debugging"
	depends on SSB && !SSB_SILENT
	help
	  This turns on additional runtime checks and debugging
	  messages. Turn this on for SSB troubleshooting.

	default y
	help
	  Driver for the Sonics Silicon Backplane attached
	  Broadcom PCI core.

	  If unsure, say Y

config SSB_PCICORE_HOSTMODE
	bool "Hostmode support for SSB PCI core"
