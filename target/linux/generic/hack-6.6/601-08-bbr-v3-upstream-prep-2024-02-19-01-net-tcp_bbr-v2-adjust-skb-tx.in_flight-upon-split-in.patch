Subject: [PATCH 08/19] net-tcp_bbr: v2: adjust skb tx.in_flight upon split in
 tcp_fragment()

When we fragment an skb that has already been sent, we need to update
the tx.in_flight for the first skb in the resulting pair ("buff").

Because we were not updating the tx.in_flight, the tx.in_flight value
was inconsistent with the pcount of the "buff" skb (tx.in_flight would
be too high). That meant that if the "buff" skb was lost, then
bbr2_inflight_hi_from_lost_skb() would calculate an inflight_hi value
that is too high. This could result in longer queues and higher packet
loss.

Packetdrill testing verified that without this commit, when the second
half of an skb is SACKed and then later the first half of that skb is
marked lost, the calculated inflight_hi was incorrect.

Effort: net-tcp_bbr
