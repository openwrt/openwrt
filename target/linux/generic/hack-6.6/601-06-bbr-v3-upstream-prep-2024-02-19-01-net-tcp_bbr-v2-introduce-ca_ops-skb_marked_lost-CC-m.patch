Subject: [PATCH 06/19] net-tcp_bbr: v2: introduce ca_ops->skb_marked_lost() CC
 module callback API

For connections experiencing reordering, RACK can mark packets lost
long after we receive the SACKs/ACKs hinting that the packets were
actually lost.

This means that CC modules cannot easily learn the volume of inflight
data at which packet loss happens by looking at the current inflight
or even the packets in flight when the most recently SACKed packet was
sent. To learn this, CC modules need to know how many packets were in
flight at the time lost packets were sent. This new callback, combined
with TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->tx.in_flight, allows them to learn this.

This also provides a consistent callback that is invoked whether
packets are marked lost upon ACK processing, using the RACK reordering
timer, or at RTO time.

Effort: net-tcp_bbr
