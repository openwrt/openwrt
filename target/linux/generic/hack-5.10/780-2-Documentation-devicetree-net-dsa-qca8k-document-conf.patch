Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Documentation: devicetree: net: dsa: qca8k: document
 configurable led support

Document binding for configurable led. Ports led can now be set on/off
and the blink/on rules can be configured using the "qca,led_rules"
binding. Refer to the Documentation on how to configure them.

 Don't use mixed external and internal mdio-bus configurations, as this is
 not supported by the hardware.
 
+A leds subnode in the phy node can be declared to configure leds port behaviour.
+The leds subnode must declare the port with the mdio reg that will have the
+attached led. Each port can have a max of 3 different leds. (Refer to example)
+A led can have 4 different settings:
+- Always off
+- Always on
+- Blink at 4hz
+- Hw_mode: This special mode follow control_rule rules and blink based on switch
+event.
+A sysfs entry for control_rule and hw_mode is provided for each led.
+Control rule for phy0-3 are shared and refer to the same reg. That means that
+phy0-3 will blink based on the same rules. Phy4 have its dedicated control_rules.
+
+Each led can have the following binding:
+The binding "default-state" can be declared to set them off by default or to
+follow leds control_rule using the keep value. By default hw_mode is set as it's
+the default switch setting.
+The binding "qca,led_rules" can be used to declare the control_rule set on
+switch setup. The following rules can be applied decalred in an array of string
+in the dts:
+- tx-blink: Led blink on tx traffic for the port
+- rx-blink: Led blink on rx traffic for the port
+- collision-blink: Led blink when a collision is detected for the port
+- link-10M: Led is turned on when a link of 10M is detected for the port
+- link-100M: Led is turned on when a link of 100M is detected for the port
+- link-1000M: Led is turned on when a link of 1000M is detected for the port
+- half-duplex: Led is turned on when a half-duplex link is detected for the port
+- full-duplex: Led is turned on when a full-duplex link is detected for the port
+- linkup-over: Led blinks only when the linkup led is on, ignore blink otherwise
+- power-on-reset: Reset led on switch reset
+- One of
+	- blink-2hz: Led blinks at 2hz frequency
+	- blink-4hz: Led blinks at 4hz frequency
+	- blink-8hz: Led blinks at 8hz frequency
+	- blink-auto: Led blinks at 2hz frequency with 10M, 4hz with 100M, 8hz
+	  with 1000M
+Due to the phy0-3 limitation, multiple use of 'qca8k_led_rules' will result in
+the last defined one to be applied.
