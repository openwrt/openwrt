Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: tag_mtk: add padding for tx packets

Padding for transmitted packets needs to account for the special tag.
With not enough padding, garbage bytes are inserted by the switch at the
end of small packets.

Fixes: 5cd8985a1909 ("net-next: dsa: add Mediatek tag RX/TX handler")
