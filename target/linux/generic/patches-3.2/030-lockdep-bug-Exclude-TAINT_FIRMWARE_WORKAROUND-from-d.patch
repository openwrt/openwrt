Subject: [PATCH 1/2] lockdep, bug: Exclude TAINT_FIRMWARE_WORKAROUND from disabling lockdep

It's unlikely that TAINT_FIRMWARE_WORKAROUND causes false
lockdep messages, so do not disable lockdep in that case.
We still want to keep lockdep disabled in the
TAINT_OOT_MODULE case:

  - bin-only modules can cause various instabilities in
    their and in unrelated kernel code

  - they are impossible to debug for kernel developers

  - they also typically do not have the copyright license
    permission to link to the GPL-ed lockdep code.
