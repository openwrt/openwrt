|Subject: [PATCH] mtd: spi-nor: Stop passing flash_info around
|
|Some functions called from spi_nor_scan() need a flash_info object.
|Let's assign nor->info early on to avoid passing info as an extra
|argument to each of these sub-functions.
|
|We also stop passing a flash_info object to set_4byte() and use
|nor->info directly.

That only assign nor->info early in order to avoid a crash in
the fixup function.
