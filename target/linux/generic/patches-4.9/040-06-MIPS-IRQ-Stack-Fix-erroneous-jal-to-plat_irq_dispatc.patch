Subject: [PATCH] MIPS: IRQ Stack: Fix erroneous jal to plat_irq_dispatch

Commit dda45f701c9d ("MIPS: Switch to the irq_stack in interrupts")
changed both the normal and vectored interrupt handlers. Unfortunately
the vectored version, "except_vec_vi_handler", was incorrectly modified
to unconditionally jal to plat_irq_dispatch, rather than doing a jalr to
the vectored handler that has been set up. This is ok for many platforms
which set the vectored handler to plat_irq_dispatch anyway, but will
cause problems with platforms that use other handlers.
