um: remove PAGE_SIZE alignment in linker script causing kernel segfault.

The linker script cleanup that I did in commit 
5d150a97f9391f5bcd7ba0d59d7a11c3de3cea80 accidentally introduced an 
ALIGN(PAGE_SIZE) when converting to use INIT_TEXT_SECTION; Richard 
Weinberger reported that this causes the kernel to segfault with 
CONFIG_STATIC_LINK=y.

I'm not certain why this extra alignment is a problem, but it seems likely 
it is because previously

__init_begin = _stext = _text = _sinittext 

and with the extra ALIGN(PAGE_SIZE), _sinittext becomes different from the 
rest.  So there is likely a bug here where something is assuming that 
_sinittext is the same as one of those other symbols.  But reverting the 
accidental change fixes the regression, so it seems worth committing that 
now.
