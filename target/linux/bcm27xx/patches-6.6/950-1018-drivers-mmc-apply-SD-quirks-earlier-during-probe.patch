Subject: [PATCH 1018/1085] drivers: mmc: apply SD quirks earlier during probe

Applying MMC_QUIRK_BROKEN_SD_CACHE is broken, as the card's extended
registers are parsed prior to the quirk being applied in mmc_blk.

Split this out into an SD-specific list of quirks and apply in
mmc_sd_init_card instead.

Fixes: c467c8f08185 ("mmc: Add MMC_QUIRK_BROKEN_SD_CACHE for Kingston Canvas Go Plus from 11/2019")
