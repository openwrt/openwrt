Subject: [PATCH] brcmfmac: Fix 802.1x

Commit 7d239fbf9d4 broke 802.1X authentication by setting
profile->use_fwsup = NONE whenever PSK is not used. However
802.1X does not use PSK and requires profile->use_fwsup set
to 1X, or brcmf_cfg80211_set_pmk() fails. Fix this by checking
that profile->use_fwsup is not already set to 1X and avoid
setting it to NONE in that case.

Fixes: 7d239fbf9d4 (brcmfmac: Fix interoperating DPP and other encryption network access)
