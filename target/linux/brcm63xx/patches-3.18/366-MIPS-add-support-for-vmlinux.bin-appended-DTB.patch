Subject: [PATCH RFC v3] MIPS: add support for vmlinux.bin appended DTB

Add support for populating initial_boot_params through a dtb
blob appended to raw vmlinux.bin.

Signed-off-by: Jonas Gorski <jogo@openwrt.org>

Changes RFC v2 -> v3

* fixed !smp kernels (TODO: move it to its own patch

Changes RFC v1 -> v2

* changed all occurences of vmlinux to vmlinux.bin
* clarified this applies to the raw vmlinux.bin without decompressor
* s/initial_device_params/initial_boot_params/

Initial comments by me still valid:

Mostly adapted from how ARM is doing it.

Sent as an RFC PATCH because I am not sure if this is the right way to
it, and whether storing the pointer in initial_boot_params is a good
idea, or a new variable should be introduced.

The reasoning for initial_boot_params is that there is no common
MIPS interface yet, so the next best thing was using that. This also
has the advantage of keeping the original fw_args intact.

This patch works for me on bcm63xx, where the bootloader expects
an lzma compressed kernel, so I didn't want to double compress using
the in-kernel compressed kernel support.

Completely untested on anything except MIPS32 / big endian.
