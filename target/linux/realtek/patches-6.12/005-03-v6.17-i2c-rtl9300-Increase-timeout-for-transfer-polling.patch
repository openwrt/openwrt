Subject: [PATCH] i2c: rtl9300: Increase timeout for transfer polling

The timeout for transfers was only set to 2ms. Because of this relatively
low limit, 12-byte read operations to the frontend MCU of a RTL8239 POE PSE
chip cluster was consistently resulting in a timeout.

The original OpenWrt downstream driver [1] was not using any timeout limit
at all. This is also possible by setting the timeout_us parameter of
regmap_read_poll_timeout() to 0. But since the driver currently implements
the ETIMEDOUT error, it is more sensible to increase the timeout in such a
way that communication with the (quite common) Realtek I2C-connected POE
management solution is possible.
