Subject: [PATCH] ARM: mach-qcom: fix support for ipq806x

Add a specific config flag for Qcom IPQ806x as this SoC can't use
AUTO_ZRELADDR and require the PHYS_OFFSET set to 0x42000000.

This is needed as some legacy board (or some wrongly configured
bootloader) pass the wrong memory map and doesn't exclude the first
~20MB of RAM reserved for the hardware network accellerators.

With this change we can correctly support each board and prevent any
kind of misconfiguration done by the OEM.
