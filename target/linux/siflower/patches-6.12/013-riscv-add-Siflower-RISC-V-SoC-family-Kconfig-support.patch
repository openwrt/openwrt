Subject: [PATCH 13/20] riscv: add Siflower RISC-V SoC family Kconfig support

Siflower RISC-V SoCs, including SF21A6826, SF21H8898 and some other
upcomping chips, are RISC-V chips with T-Head C908 cores for home
routers and gateways. Add a Kconfig entry named ARCH_SIFLOWER for
them.
Notably these chips uses ARM PL011 for UART. ARM_AMBA is selected
for its driver.
