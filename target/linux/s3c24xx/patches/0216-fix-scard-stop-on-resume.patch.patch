Subject: [PATCH] fix-scard-stop-on-resume.patch
 Reported-by: Ville-Pekka Vainio <vpivaini@cs.helsinki.fi>

The reporter noticed SD Card clock is running again after resume.  After
looking at the code I saw I missed two tricks, this will force it off
after resume and will do better generally depending on what the last SD Card
packet was.

Since bulk read packet is normally last action (which set the clock off even
without this) the old patch worked for normal cases.  But after resume, the last
packet on the wire was not a bulk transfer and we didn't take care about the
clock then.
