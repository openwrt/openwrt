Subject: [PATCH] sdio: use interruptible sleep in kthread main loops

My FreeRunner's load average was leveling off at 2.00 as a result of
these two kernel threads:

This fixes them to use interruptible sleep primitives while waiting in
their main loops, as is conventional for kernel threads.  They can't
actually be interrupted since kernel threads ignore all signals, but
by sleeping this way they get classified as long term waiters, and
don't get counted as running for purposes of load average calculation.

This is intended as a minimal fix.  In the longer term, it'd probably
make sense to replace the semaphores with completions or something,
and to do away with some of these StudlyCapped wrapper functions.

This is untested, but what could possibly go wrong?  ;)
