Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: b53: prevent SWITCH_CTRL access on BCM5325
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

BCM5325 doesn't implement SWITCH_CTRL register so we should avoid reading
or writing it.

Fixes: a424f0de6163 ("net: dsa: b53: Include IMP/CPU port in dumb forwarding mode")
