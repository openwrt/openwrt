Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix label name of hdptxphy for RK3588

The hdptxphy is a combo transmit-PHY for HDMI2.1 TMDS Link, FRL Link, DP
and eDP Link. Therefore, it is better to name it hdptxphy0 other than
hdptxphy_hdmi0, which will be referenced by both hdmi0 and edp0 nodes.

[added armsom-sige7, where hdmi-support was added recently and also
 the hdptxphy0-as-dclk source I just added]
