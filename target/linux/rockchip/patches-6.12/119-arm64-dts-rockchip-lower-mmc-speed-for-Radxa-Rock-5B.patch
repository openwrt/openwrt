Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: lower mmc speed for Radxa Rock 5B

The previously stated speed of sdr-104 in is too high for the hardware
to reliably communicate with some fast SD cards.
Rockchip boards have a common bug when operating uhs speed, which will
hang the system during a soft reboot.

To be on the safe side, lower the speed to workaround.
