Subject: [PATCH] clk: rockchip: rk3568: mark hclk_vi as critical

The clock 'pclk_vi_niu' has a dependency on 'hclk_vi_niu' according
to the Technical Reference Manual section '2.8.6 NIU Clock gating
reliance'. However, this kind of dependency cannot be addressed
properly at the moment (until the support for linked clocks is
implemented for the RK3568).
As an intermediate solution, mark the hclk_vi as critical on the
Rockchip RK3568.
